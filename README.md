### Description

This is a quick demo of thievery. It demonstrates how to steal

the Treeview from the BrowseForFolder dialog for use by

us poor VB coders.
 
### More Info
 
Prividing a Treeview for navigating local hard drives can be tricky.

Getting it to also include the LAN is even trickier. The task when

using a VB Treeview, whilst not impossible by any means, involves

quite a lot of code and is never quite as fast as Windows.

The job becomes even harder when trying to obtain all

the System Icons.
